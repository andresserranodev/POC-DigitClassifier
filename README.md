# Digit Classifier Android App

This repository contains an Android application that demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification. The project serves educational purposes, showcasing how to train a neural network and integrate it into an Android application.

## Overview

The application is built using Jetpack Compose and implements a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset. The model was trained using Google Colab, and the resulting TensorFlow Lite model is integrated into the Android application.
